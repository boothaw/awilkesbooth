                One story about writing a creative brief for birdseed. That was enough to make me reconsider using my advertising degree. After a while I realized how much I loved building, problem solving and continual learning.
                  I started looking for a career that would challenge me in those areas. The more development I did, the more I excited I got. I still feel that way now 2+ years later.

                After hours (sometimes before), I like to surf.
